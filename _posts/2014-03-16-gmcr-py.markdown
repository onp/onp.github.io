Inspired by a course I took with [Professor Keith Hipel][hipel], I developed a new piece of modelling software for people working with the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution.  Written in python, the package supports the construction and analysis of conflicts using both a command line interface and a GUI.  Many thanks to Rami Kinsara who has played a major role in this project.

Source files for the program as well as a standalone windows installer are available on [github][gmcr-py].
